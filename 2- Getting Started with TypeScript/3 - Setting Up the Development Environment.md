# Setting Up The Development Environment

- First thing we need is nodejs, because we are going to use npm (node package manager) to install the typescript compiler.

```
Steps to download nodejs :

1. Download the latest version of node from https://nodejs.org/en/.

2. Run the installer and follow the steps.

3. Open terminal window we should run the following

  - npm i -g typescript

npm - is used for installing third party packages in our case its typescript

i - is short for install

-g - for installing this globally, so we access the typescript complier in every folder.

typescript - its a name of the package.

Now to verify our installation we should run

  - tsc -v

tsc - that is short of typescript compiler

-v - version

4. We will be using Visual Studio Code.
```
